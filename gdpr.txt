1. If you are collecting user data, how do you inform your customers why you’re
processing their data? Do you have mechanisms in place for users to deny consent
of data processing? *

We can have a message informing our customers why we're processing their data on
our sign up page together with an agreement checkbox to make clear that:

1) We collect user metadata (age, gender, marital status, education and political
leaning) when a user signs up to support our poll statistics filtering feature
(e.g. you can check to see what percentage of high school users prefers pizzas
with pineapples).

2) We record polls a user has answered or created to support our history page for
the user and to support our suggestion algorithm.

3) To protect user privacy, when recording a poll a user has answered, we only link
the poll response with the user's metadata instead of the user's ID so that the
user's response is not trackable.

We currently don't have mechanisms in place for users to deny consent of data
processing - we require sign-in for a user to use our web APP. However, we could
create a visitor mode for users who deny consent of data processing. In this mode,

1) Users do not need to sign in and we won't collect user metadata.

2) We don't record polls a user has answered.

3) Correspondingly, poll feed is random instead of being related to user interests,
users in this mode could not view their history of answered polls, and users in this
mode could not create polls (For better management, all created polls are linked with
the user who created it. We wish to maintain a friendly online environment so the users
should be responsible for what they have created.).

2. If you are not directly processing user data, what data are you processing and
why? Are your data processing techniques made clear to your users? How? *

We do process user data directly.

3. What data processing do you do, and how would you ensure that it is done safely,
if you don’t already? How would you secure your project against possible malfunctions
/crashes? *

4. Let’s say that your database is compromised - what is the worst case scenario for
your app? Your users? How do you protect against a breach? What steps have you taken
to ensure that the data you’re storing in your database is protected? This could
include protecting your inputs to avoid injection attacks, encrypting user data to
avoid password leaks, etc. *
